1. Overview
-----------

I'm experimenting with writing all forms of fiction and non-fiction using [GitHub](http://github.com/ "GitHub"), [WriteMonkey](http://writemonkey.com "WriteMonkey") and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Home of Markdown"). 

This project was given life mostly because I've started to find it hard to get ideas down quickly. I dismiss little kernels or phrases out of hand because I fail to see the immediate value of them, or else am intimidated by their scale. 

The idea, as it sits in my head, is the master branch will be used as an *ideas repository*, a place where I can dump titles, snippets, thoughts, outlines etc.. Each *fork* will be its own complete piece, be that a tweet (lame), blog (slightly less lame), article (cool), or long-form piece (awesome). Within the fork will be that piece's own unique outline, idea board/map and finished content. 

If the model works, I'll probably write more about it. As it is, I guess I should just "suck it and see".
