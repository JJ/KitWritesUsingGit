5 Reasons Why Inbound Marketing Beats Cold Calling Every Time
============================

The post-Jackson world is a strange, strange place for small practices, especially those who've traditionally relied on claims management companies to provide them with leads. With the noose ever tightening around our easiest route to market, what can we do to combat the almost inevitable decline in business?

Online marketing is something that, as an industry, we've shied away from. The barrier to entry can be relatively high, the learning curve steep and the pitfalls too numerous to count. But what if I told you that the real trick to Internet marketing isn't knowing your HTML from your JavaScript - it's just about knowing how to have a meaningful conversation?

Content Is King
---------------

It's not a secret - people are more likely to buy from people they trust, and in today's market we need to view ourselves as salesmen and ambassadors for our products. The best salesmen - the ones who don't need to paint their customers into corners, but rather let them come to decisions themselves - are evangelists, and who's a better evangelist for your business than you?

By providing potential customers with content that's of real use that simultaneously extols the values of your product, you can engage with an entirely new audience of people that a) already know what you do and b) know that you're informed and active in the space you're working in. This beats any cold-calling CMC hands down and shifts the paradigm - your clients don't feel harassed into making a claim, and you have complete control over their onboarding and flow through your company. 

With no further ado, here's our top 5 reasons why your business should be looking at inbound marketing as the next step in your lead sourcing.

### 1. Inbound Marketing Builds Trust

To an extent, inbound marketing is a "long game", meaning you're investing time now in order to get a return in the future. The advantage is that you've already provided your potential customer with something of *value*. By giving them something they can use for *free* you're more likely to attract their *paid* business in the future, and you've established yourself as a trustworthy and authoritive voice.

### 2. Inbound Marketing Costs Nothing But Time

Though time's at a premium in all of our lives, 30 minutes a day spent on the core inbound activities - blogging, website optimisation, social media interaction, content curation and sharing - could help bring down your average cost-per-lead by 62%, with no capital investment. 

### 3. Inbound Marketing = SEO

By taking control of your inbound marketing and focussing your efforts around your website, you're acting as your own Search Engine Optimisation consultant. Creating content that people *want* to read and share, placing the main bulk on your website and sharing it through multiple channels can help your site to seem more *trustworthy* and so appear higher in Google and Bing's search results.

### 4. Inbound Marketing Covers Thousands of Channels

By using a CMC, you're limiting yourself to a single sales/marketing channel with a high cost. By making the switch to inbound, the blog that you write for your site can be shared on Twitter and Facebook, be broken down into an infographic to share on BuzzFeed or Pinterest, be turned into a presentation to throw up on Slideshare, a webinar, a workshopâ€¦the possibilities are as endless as the number of channels available. It also means that, if one of your channels should become closed, you have many others still available to use.

### 5. Inbound Marketing Snowballs Over Time

Rather than print advertising which, by its nature, is ephemeral, inbound marketing sticks around. As you create more content, you're creating a database of knowledge and wisdom that potential clients - and you! - can draw upon months or years in the future. This is the power of inbound - the long tail. The content you create will keep working for you.
